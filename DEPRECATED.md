# ⚠️ Deprecated Project

This project (`base58_decoder_to_hex.py`) is now considered **deprecated** and has been officially **superseded** by a more advanced and modular tool:

👉 **[btc_address_analyzer.py](https://github.com/BitMorphX/btc_address_analyzer)**

The new tool was built with a smarter architecture and long-term extensibility in mind.

---

## 🚫 Why this version is deprecated

While `base58_decoder_to_hex.py` served well as a lightweight Base58Check decoder, its design was intentionally minimal. It lacks deeper address structure analysis, address type classification, and extensibility.

---

## ✅ Why switch to the new tool?

**`btc_address_analyzer.py`** introduces a more intelligent decoding engine with:

- 🧠 Smarter structure with modular components  
- 🧾 Full Bitcoin address introspection  
- 🔍 Automatic address type detection (P2PKH, P2SH, etc.)  
- 📦 Payload analysis and version inspection  
- 🎨 Improved color output via `termcolor`  
- 🧩 Extensible CLI interface  
- 🔐 Ready for further protocol expansion (Bech32, Taproot)

---

## 📌 Recommendation

We strongly encourage all users, developers, and analysts to migrate to the new analyzer for improved clarity, extensibility, and long-term maintainability.

## 📂 Legacy Status

This repo will remain online for reference, archival, and educational purposes — but **no further development or support** is planned.

**Stay sharp. Work clean. Choose the right tools.**
