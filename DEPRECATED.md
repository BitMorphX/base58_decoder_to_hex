# ⚠️ Deprecated Project

This project (`base58_decoder_to_hex.py`) has been **superseded** by a better and more structured tool:

👉 **[btc_address_analyzer.py](https://github.com/BitMorphX/btc_address_analyzer)**

The new version includes:
- Clear UI structure
- Address type detection
- Payload analysis
- Color output via `termcolor`
- Better extensibility

---

You are encouraged to switch to the new tool for improved clarity and features.
